There is a need to have a database which can be used for both snmp, netconf 
it should be able to represent the device logically which can be walked get/set etc.
via snmp & netconf.
If there is a solution for it then it can be used for Cacti, Weathermap and other type of RRD tool for pulling the information.

What is in-memory DB?
